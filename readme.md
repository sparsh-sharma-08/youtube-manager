# Video Manager

## 📄 Description
The **Video Manager** is a beginner-friendly Python program designed to manage a collection of YouTube videos. It provides an interactive interface for performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on video data. This project serves as a practical implementation of file handling and database integration concepts in Python.

## 🚀 Features
- **List Videos**: View all saved videos along with their duration.
- **Add Videos**: Add new video details (name and duration).
- **Update Videos**: Modify the details of existing videos.
- **Delete Videos**: Remove videos from the database.
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses SQLite to store and retrieve video data.

## ✨ Learnings
This project helped me understand and implement:
1. **File Handling**: Learned how to work with JSON files for data storage and manipulation.
2. **Database Integration**: Gained practical experience in SQL and SQLite, including performing CRUD operations directly within a Python program.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- SQLite (Database)

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-manager.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd video-manager
    ```
3. Run the script
    ```bash
    python file_name.py
    ```

## 📝Future Improvements
- Add support for categorizing videos (e.g., by genre or playlist).
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user interaction.
- Enhance search functionality to filter videos by name or duration.
